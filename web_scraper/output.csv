"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."
"I love the 2nd generation Airpods, more than the most recent models, this is basically due to the comfort they offer, they are really comfortable when placed in the ears.What do I like about these airpods?:- The physical ergonomics of the product are very comfortable in the ear, it does not fall out or hurt as the hours go by.- The connectivity between the airpod and the iPhone is almost perfect, it almost always works very well and pairs well, although there are times when only one earbud can be heard but it is solved by putting them back in their case, sometimes it can be a little annoying but it is done. I hold on.- The audio quality is very good, it sounds really good.- The quality of the microphone when I am on calls with other people is very good, the person I am talking to always hears me very well and without interference or strange sounds.- You can buy the case you want to protect them.- Quick compatibility with the iPad.- Obviously it does not have noise cancellation, but for that I have another full headset product, I use these airpods while I pay attention to what is happening in the environment, I would not like to be isolated, and above all it sounds good and for calls it is excellent."
"The Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) are a popular choice for wireless earbuds, and they come with a Lightning charging case that offers a convenient way to charge and store them. Here's a detailed review based on my experience:Sound Quality (4/5):The sound quality of these earbuds is generally good. They deliver clear and well-balanced audio, making them suitable for a wide range of music genres and audio content. However, some audiophiles may find that they lack the depth and richness found in higher-end headphones.Wireless Connectivity (5/5):Apple has always excelled in creating seamless wireless connections, and the AirPods are no exception. The pairing process is incredibly easy, and they seamlessly connect to your Apple devices via Bluetooth. The connection remains stable, and you can switch between devices effortlessly.Comfort and Fit (4/5):The AirPods are designed to be comfortable for extended use. They're lightweight and fit snugly in most ears. However, some users might find them a bit loose during intense physical activities or while running.Battery Life (4/5):The included Lightning charging case offers an additional 24 hours of battery life, making it easy to keep the earbuds powered up throughout the day. While this is a decent battery life, there are other models on the market that offer even longer playtime.Charging (4/5):The Lightning connector is both a pro and a con. It's convenient if you already own Apple devices, but it's limiting if you use other devices with different charging ports. It would be great to have USB-C compatibility for broader appeal.Voice Assistant Integration (5/5):The AirPods have excellent voice assistant integration with Siri, making it effortless to control your music, check the weather, or send messages with just your voice.Price (3/5):The AirPods are on the higher end of the price range for wireless earbuds. While they offer a great experience, some users might find more affordable options with similar features from other brands.Overall (4/5):The Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) are a solid choice for those in the Apple ecosystem who want reliable wireless earbuds with seamless connectivity and good sound quality. They are comfortable for daily use and come with a convenient charging case. However, the price may deter budget-conscious shoppers, and the Lightning connector might be inconvenient for non-Apple users. If you're willing to invest in quality wireless earbuds and enjoy the Apple ecosystem, these are a great pick."
"I love Apple products.  Why?  Because they are simple and work great. I've used generic earbuds before and they use to annoy the hell out of me.  No matter how many earpieces I use, they always manage to pop out of my ears at the worst possible time.  Try finding your earbud that fell on to the floor of a packed subway car.  Not fun.  I have the generation 2 as well as the generation 2 pro.  Generation 2 Pro wins hands down but it is pricey.  For the average user, who doesn't need all the bells and whistles, gen 2 is just fine.  But, be warn, there are limited functions by touch.  There is stop/play/forward/rewind.  The noise cancellation is above average.  The sound quality is also above average.  When using it on calls, the sound is clear and crisp.  If you have an iPhone, it pairs automatically.  On rare occasions, the airpods become disconnected and I have to manually pair them again.  I don't know why this happens.  But, it is something you should be aware of.  Overall, I think it is an above average wireless airpods."
"If you have an apple phone, you should definitely get these. Don't opt for the ""cheaper brands of airpods"". It's worth every penny. I know as I got a few cheaper brands and they only lasted a few months, were too bulky and didn't fit right in my ears and took forever to connect. Glad I bought these and will only purchase Apple airpods moving forward."

"Let's first start off with noise cancellation: It's non-existent. You WILL hear everything going on around you, with turning the volume up just damaging your ears. This is due to the AirPod kind of laying inside your ear, which doesn't create a seal as in earbuds with silicone tips. This not only kills any noise cancellation, but will cause sound to bleed to the outside when loud enough (say around 50%).The issues above are also benefits in environments like offices or schools. This is thanks to the lack of noise cancellation. With music playing, talking to someone sounds just the same as without them. In addition, without a seal being created in your ear, they have to be louder than usual, which they certainly are (Not by a huge margin, but a noticeable one). Now for the stem of the AirPods, they aren't just for show. The microphones in the stem help make calls sound clear and usable.The shape of the AirPods are a hit-or-miss. They'll either fit you or they won't. The best way you could test this is by trying on some EarPods, as they are pretty much AirPods with wires (design-wise). For me, they fit my ears, but start to slip off on their own. They don't fall, but they give me the sensation that they will. You can fix this with some rubber hooks that go on the AirPods to hold them in place inside your ears (You'll need to remove them when putting them back in their case though).The battery life is...fine. It's not abysmal and will last you a good while, but it's not anything to write home about. At least the pop-up when opening the case will remind you of charging them (On an iPhone, I don't think it'll do this on Android). It charges via lightning, but there is a version available with a wireless charging case if you'd like.Sound quality is good, but not perfect. Bass is not it's strong point, and some instruments do get muffled out on some tracks. Vocals can be heard well (which helps out on calls) though. Disclaimer: I'm not an audiophile, just a guy that listens to music for hours.Initial pairing is relatively simple on an iPhone/Mac, just open them while being close to your intended device. The AirPods connect nearly instant when taking them out of the case. While I can't speak for Android or Windows devices, I would assume that they would pair the same way as any other devices, but don't take my word for it.Also, there is no official water/sweat resistance to them. I haven't used them in these environments, but have heard stories of them surviving washing machines (Which I will not be testing). Take that with a grain of salt though.Overall, they are great earphones for me, but make sure you know what you need of your earphones first. If you make a lot of calls and want to hear everything around you, these are the ones to go for."
Can’t believe it took me this long to try Air Pods. They sound EXCELLENT. Easy to use. Super comfy. My only qualm is the lid of the case feels like it will 100% break one day if it catches anything in motion so just be careful. Really do love these headphones though.
"It’s Apple.  While there will always be something better out there, these head phones fit snug and sound rather well.  The quality is well built and holds up to the Apple standards and it syncs effortless with your phone."
"These are great ear buds.  The only thing I did not like is the charging set up.  They come with their own charger.  I only use them once a month or so, mostly when travelling.  If I leave them in the case, the battery drains and I have to charge before using.  I don't like to leave them plugged in because that seems to destroy the batteries quickly.  My last set only lasted for a year.  I found a device called Charge-O-Matic on Amazon. It's a long term timer that I plugged my USB charger into.  I set it to come on every 30 days for 8 hours.  Now my Airpods are always charged and ready to go and I love them."
"I didn't want pods that I have to cram in my ear canals. These sit on the ear and provide great sound when paired to my iPhone. I thought the lack of noise cancellations would be an issue but it isn't. It's not hard to hear the music and tone out the background sounds. I use these in a gym, a very noisy place, and they're fine.One complaint is they fall out when lying on my back. So I have to remove them for entertain types of workouts.You need to remove one plug from the case near the phone to have the charge levers displayed. There's no indication of the state of charge on the case itself."
"These have become part of my daily routine more than just a tech accessory have become an integral part of my daily routine. The simplicity of setup, where they seamlessly connect with my devices, has made them my go-to audio companion. What stands out beyond the technicalities is the immersive experience they provide, powered by the Apple H1 headphone chip. Whether it's losing myself in a podcast during a morning jog or catching up on my favorite tunes while cooking, the high-quality sound never fails to impress. The ""Hey Siri"" feature has made me feel like I'm in the future, and the fact that they intuitively pause when taken out of my ears is a small yet delightful touch. The 24-hour battery life is a real game-changer, and the ability to share audio with another set of AirPods makes them a versatile tool for both solitude and shared moments."
"The third generation sounds like years ahead of the second generation AirPods. The third generation has much fuller, delicate attributes. Where the second generation is just good. The third generation AirPods also have sound comparable to the much more expensive AirPod Pros but without a rubber suction cup in your ear canal. In that regard these second generation are the same, very comfortable. But I really would put down a little more money and get the third generation AirPods. You’ll be glad you did."
I love AirPods I am a delivery driver and don’t have a stereo so I put one in while driving to listen to music and when it’s about to die I switch to the other one also when someone calls I can answer right away you switch songs and answer phone just by tapping it the charging case is awesome I would recommend getting a cover for the case
Works wonderfully and my last pair lasted me for 4 years before I unvendible left it in the pockets of my jacket when in the washer. Long lasting battery with the small and compact factor.
"I like the air pods. They worked as advertised. They are comfortable and when shaking my head they don't fall out of my ear. I used then with iPhone and iPad. The sound is great and easy to hear. Remembering to turn iPad and iPhone volume down is a must because when a call comes in, it's so loud and will shock you while you're working on something else. I like it because you can accept or decline the call. If you decline the call, you can continue working and if you accept, you can continue your work after the call. I set up with 3 months free for music on Amazon. I don't usually do this, but I want to use them while listening to music when doing the dishwasher, since I am the dish washer. Smile! My kitchen is very small and gets very warm. So I may add to this review later."
"I was so excited to get these on Amazon day!  The price was too good to pass up and my son had these exact ones so I knew they would be great since I tried his out and they were! Easy to pair with your phone, great sound, doesn't fall out of your ears when walking or bending.  Overall a great wireless  ear bud and cheaper than BJ's!"
"First time ever using AirPods. They are excellent, fit well and don’t fall out of my ears, the sound isn’t overpowering but still high quality, and it connects to devices super fast."
I love my AirPods. I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn’t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature. Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they’ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more.Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice.I’ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don’t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I’ve had. I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time.First off I’m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can’t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I’m sure that they don’t I can’t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it’s going to have better sound quality.But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case. The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used. If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing. The talk time on them is very long as well. I’ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says.I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they’ve connected if I’m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses. I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it’s from if they’re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone.I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad.I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone. Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc. and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great.So in the end I think that they are amazing and I’ve had it again a number of different Bluetooth headsets and they never fit right they fall out of my ear or the ones that took over my ears are always so uncomfortable after a short period of time that I never ended up using them I always ended up using my wired earbuds that come with my iPhone.
Connected to my phone easily came with a case to my understanding I thought I was just ordering the air pods in case separately but they came together fits perfectly in my ears .
"Perfect condition. Still in its original packaging and with plastic still wrapped around them. The work amazing, as always. I’m just glad I found a good price for my replacement pair, since I lost my other pair."
I waited for 2 additional days and still have not received the package. I’m sure they are great but they have to be delivered to be usable. Also I paid 10$ more for shipping hoping I can get a refund on shipping
"I got these AirPods back in June of 2021 and they are still kickin'! I've known friends who have had their AirPods stop working/break, but mine have lasted and I wouldn't say I'm the most careful person when handling them. The sound quality and battery are still comparable to when I first purchased them.They are definitely affordable in comparison to the AirPod Pros, but if you're looking for comfort you may want to test these before buying somehow. I find that I can't wear them for too long or my ears become agitated."
Love these AirPods. It automatically synced to my iPhone and iPad right off. Didn’t even have to set my name came ready w my name. Nice sounding load and crisp. Fits perfect in my ears! And I love how u pull one out an it stops. Such an upgrade for me! Super happy with these
"I purchased these AirPods on a discounted rate to give them a try. They work great. They fit my ears well, where many others do not. The sound quality is clear. They were easy to pair with my phone. I look forward to continuing to use them."
"Purchased these during BF sales and it's definitely one of my best buys.  Although a tad bit more bass would be awesome, the overall sound is great. Phone calls are clear and the battery life is average. Having the charging case with you is a bonus."
"I’ve never used an apple airpod prior to 2023 but so far its been a good experience. I use this casually and at work. The airpods do have some difficulty staying on my ear at first but the problem goes away after my ears get used to the shape. There are some touch control things in the pod itself, but its just play, pause, restart/back a track, and vice versa.This airpod doesn’t have noise cancellation, its got no silicone tips to enclose your ear. Because of that, its very good in environments where you still need to hear and want to listen to music (unless you max out the volume).At the time of this writing, I’ve used my new airpods for about three weeks. I usually use one pod at a time and leave it on till it dies. They last me about 8 hrs on a full charge."
"I use this product for the gym mainly.  The AirPods do the job but I wish they had buttons on the AirPod for adjusting volume. I like how the AirPods announce text messages and other alerts you receive on your phone, a dislike is that sometimes they do not connect.  I have to put the AirPods back into the case and then take them out again in order for them to connect.  Battery life is great and sound quality is decent"
"This is my first pair of airpods, I've been using them for about a month now with no issues. Sound quality is clear and they seem to hold a charge for quite a bit, I'm happy with them."
"Love these so much better than the Pros. These fit wonderfully into my ear. I work out with them, run, and just clean around the house. I've never had an issue with these bouncing out as I work out. The battery life is great. I can wear them at work for a full 8 hours."
This is my second pair of this specific pair of AirPods. I had the first pair for almost 4 years before they started losing sound. These are a great purchase.
"The Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) have been a total game-changer for my daily life! As a long-time Apple user, I finally decided to invest in these wireless earbuds, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.First and foremost, the convenience they offer is unparalleled. The seamless pairing process with my iPhone was effortless, and they automatically connect as soon as I place them in my ears. I love the way the music automatically pauses when I remove one AirPod, and resumes as soon as I put it back in. It's such a small detail, but it makes a world of difference in my listening experience.The sound quality of these AirPods is fantastic. The audio is clear, crisp, and surprisingly rich, even in bass-heavy tracks. I'm genuinely impressed by how well they deliver music, podcasts, and calls, providing an immersive experience whether I'm working out or simply commuting.The wireless design is another aspect that I adore. The freedom of not having to deal with tangled wires or constantly readjusting earbuds during a workout is liberating. They fit comfortably and securely in my ears, even during intense activities, and I've never experienced any discomfort.The battery life is excellent as well. With the included charging case, I can easily extend the playtime throughout the day without worrying about running out of power. The case itself charges quickly, making it ready for use whenever I need it.As someone who frequently uses Siri on my iPhone, the seamless integration with these AirPods is a huge plus. The hands-free access to Siri is incredibly convenient for changing tracks, adjusting volume, or simply answering calls without reaching for my phone.I also appreciate the lightning charging feature. It aligns perfectly with my other Apple devices, and it's one less cable to worry about when traveling or charging on the go.One minor downside is that the AirPods are relatively expensive compared to other wireless earbuds on the market. However, the quality, performance, and user experience justify the investment for me.In conclusion, the Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) have exceeded my expectations in every way. The seamless connectivity, top-notch sound quality, comfortable fit, and convenient features make them an indispensable accessory for any Apple user. While they may be on the pricier side, I believe they are worth every penny for the unmatched experience they provide. I highly recommend these wireless earbuds to anyone looking for a superior listening experience and ultimate convenience on a daily basis!"
These EarPods have great sound and work perfectly!  My favorite features are the rechargeable case and that they turn off when you remove it from your ear.
"Before I spent the money on these, I started out with a cheap imitation and found  I was OK with AirPods.  So I bought the real thing and think they're great.  The difference in sound quality between the two pairs is notable.  Apple products are always better than imitators."
So far so good. I was so scared because of the reviews of people saying they received used and opened items 😐. But my item was sealed and new.
Great earbuds!  My only problem …. The case they arrive in (white) is a hard item to keep clean.  I love the fit and sound quality.  The case is the only problem.
My son had flushed his old AirPods down the toilet. I ordered these to replace them. Great value and works exactly as described. We have had no issues and these have not been flushed yet!
"I finally got these! Thank you Amazon Deal Days! I really like the features that integrate with my iPhone, like Siri availability, Notifications delivered quietly with a little info (so you know if you need to deal with it now or not), tap controls you can customize, good sound for listening to anything and phone calls for hands free movement. I had a friend say the sound on a call was in and out a couple times at when I first got them (she’s in Canada), but they seem to have settled in nicely on every call, and no complaints since. I can’t hear what’s going on around me much while listening to music, etc. If doing exercise, would get a gadget to make sure they didn’t fall out. Very pleased overall!"
"I use these all day and literally almost all night! Either the case is always charged to 100% or the airpods are, so I'm able to use them all day long. I also sleep with them in so I can listen to my overnight meditations. Most of the time, they seem to make it through 3/4s of the night before the charge dies. And the thing I really love about them, which is different than lesser quality airpods, is that they connect via bluetooth almost instantly, as soon as I put them in my ears. I found with cheaper quality airpods, it was always a struggle to get them to connect to my iphone."
God bless i thought tgese were gonna be auirter and im thankful they arent battery isnt the best on the market but it lasts a good while
"I bought them on prime day for a deal, but the price went down again recently. I reached out to customer service, and they were very nice to provide a price match and refunded to my prime membership charge credit card!"
Easy to connect. Great value for price and I’ve always loved the way the original design fit my ears. I’ll by again if I ever need to.
These are great for the price I have had the pros which are obviously better but more expensive. These are not noise cancelling but work well
"super easy to connect, they fell multiple times (concrete, snow) and still work perfectly.Also buy protection for the case, its so much handy and will save you from scratches and damaging."
This is what a family member wanted so she chose this item because she had them before but lost them.  She really liked them
"I have an I phone and have used “wire connected ear buds” TOO LONG! I have no idea why, but I purchased these and I can’t say wow, enough!! I have small ears and they fit fine because of the contour. Love the case, magnetic so they don’t fall out, charge quickly. I haven’t paid attention to the longevity of time allowance, but I believe it stated four hours? I just keep my case with me and have adapters everywhere I go anyway so I never run into a problem. The sound is so magnificent. It’s better than any earbud I’ve ever used. The sound is clear, earbuds are durable."
"These AirPods are authentic. They have a very clear sound. Case maintains a good, long charge. Fits comfortably in my ears; and, my holes are small."

They have great sound quality and stay charged for a long time too. Easy to use and lightweight. Works great super happy about this purchase!
"At first I was very skeptical of them being the legit apple AirPods or not, but I can for sure say they are the real apple AirPods, they sound amazing, fit in my ear amazing, and are by far the best purchase I have ever made on Amazon, 10/10 would recommend"
"After Siri rewards a message to you, the volume of whatever media you're listening to seems to go either up or down. Outside of that, she loves them. Great battery life, definitely helps out with your work day and quality is excellent with excellent user friendly options within the settings."
Very good AirPods !!! Sound is amazing ! Case is good installation was very easy too connect !! And it came with a charger !
"Let me start by saying that given the price, I didn't actually have high expectations for these. I'm pleased to say that I was pleasantly surprised. They definitely live to Apples quality that we've come to except from their products. The sound in my opinion is excellent and all of the features such as pause, next track and prior track work effortlessly with 2 taps. Paring was a breeze and instant. So far the battery life is decent. That said, I have noticed that the actual case loses its charge a bit faster then the pods themselves but its nothing extreme. All in all I'm very happy with my purchase. They also came quickly. I ordered them on a Tues. night and had them by Thurs. afternoon. For those who are concerned about receiving fakes, they are NOT fake. For over 2 months prior to purchasing these I did sooooo much reading and spent all day Thurs putting them to the test according to what Apple suggests for comparing real vs fake, and then some. Geez, who knew that there are so many ways to check for the authenticity of these. Trust me when I say I did everything! I would caution you not to go my the serial number alone. Sadly the scammers are finding ways around that now according to almost ever article I read including Apple. Perhaps the easiest way to is to check on your "" find my"" app. Apparently the knock offs won't show up on that app. And that's straight from Apple. The second best way I found was, with you ipods connected, go to settings > general > About & scroll down until you see Carrier Lock, just under that you should be able to see your name and airpods. Click on that and then you should be able to see manufacturer, model #, serial #, firmware version and hardware version. If thats missing they're  fake. I know that info is also on another part of the phone but thats where you need to see it. According to Apple that information along with ""find my"" are the 2 thing that scammers have yet been able to get around. So with all of that said if you're considering the purchase from here I would say do it. It's a great price and it's not a 3party seller. You can always check it out yourself after receiving them and if need be send them back. And for what its worth, I actually have a pair Beats Wireless earbuds and I personally think these ipods sound much better. I hope this helps. Happy listening."
"I like the fact that they fit perfect in my ear without me having to keep pushing them in. I bought the AirPod 3 first and they was hurting me so bad I had to keep jamming them in my ear to even hear. Gave them to my daughter. I got these, the 2s and these are great. I’ve had them in all day and have been dancing around and playing with the kids and they are still in my ear. I had forgot that they were which is scary bc I can easily lose them. When I purchased these they arrived half charged and the charging cord and case didn’t work at all so I had to send back and wait two days for the replacement pair. When I got the second pair, the cord didn’t work again however I had a few around the house to use. I couldn’t tell if the case was charging bc this model has no charging indicator unless it’s the light when you open the case. Anyhow, the only way that I was able to see if the case was charging was either one or both of the pods have to be inside the case. If both are in my ear I wouldn’t be able to see if it was charging so I would think that the case was broke and defective. I finally put both pods back in and the case showed up on my phone indicating that it was charging. I took one pod out and was still able to see it charging. When I took both buds out I could not tell if the case was even charging at all until I waited about 30 minutes put both pods back in then the indicator showed back up on my phone on full percent almost. That’s going to be annoying. So far so good on the battery life. I just got them today and have had them in since like 1:00. And they are not dead although I just had them in my ear while doing homework. Not listening to anything. The sound quality kind of sucks which I needed the noise cancellation due to me working at Amazon where it is very loud. It’s clear and good for anywhere besides a loud environment. I have not tried them at work yet but I had a knockoff brand that were louder than these so I know I’ll still have issues with the sound on these. I’ll get the pros for better sound later and give these ones to my son. Overall, I’m satisfied and I’m happy that I have these. Hopefully they perform well and lasts a while. I’ve heard others having there’s for more than three years. I recommend these if you have issues with ear comfort with other ones. These are comfortable. Love themUpdate… I did not like them after a couple days. They did start falling out with my oily ears. They wouldn’t stay in. I ordered the 2 generation pros and I’m Inlove and boy are they loud. Spend a few extra dollars and get the pros for better ear support and comfort. I’m never going back to anything else. My last review"
I switched over from 2-year-old 15$ earbuds and I'm listening to my usual songs and omg I'm noticing things I never noticed before LOL
"Bought these for my wife 2 years ago and she hasn't taken them off since. She seems to always have at least one dangling at all times, listening to YouTube and audiobooks. Sometimes she falls asleep with them on."
"I got this during a prime day sale, and it was one of my better financial decisions, as the audio is high quality, the case holds a charge for days at a time, and the headphones are really lightweight in my ears. I’ve tried to get by with cheaper Bluetooth headphones in the past, and this made me realize I should’ve just bought this and saved myself the time. It’s also easy to customize as you can buy protective cases for it."
"I can listen to music at the gym the iPods last through my whole workout, errands and still have plenty of battery power."
"I've been using them for 2 years. If I could rate it as 10 stars I would. Good quality, comfy on the ears, stylish, and a real bargain for 90$. The price fluctuates(90-100ish), so take it into consideration."
"Hesitated to get these as my ears are not symmetrical and most in ear headphones fall out. These fit, stay in, and sound great."
The Apple AirPods are excellent. They have a hard time falling out of my ear. I love the shape and comfort.They charge quickly and music sounds great.The only similar product I’ve seen is by Lenovo I have yet to try because I haven’t needed to with my AirPods! Can’t live without them nowadays.
"They are exactly what I needed.sound is very crisp and clear.battery life last long, I charge once per every five days."
In my opinion these are better than the AirPods Pro which I used to own. You don’t have to clean out the eartips or worry about losing them. The battery lasts longer on these. They sound good even without noise cancellation. They are more simpler and are less expensive.
"The description I read about this product said that the AirPods came with the medium eye tips attached and three additional sizes of tips enclosed in the box.  THERE WERE NO EARTIPS ON THE PODS OR IN THE BOX,  Luckily there is an Apple Store in our city so I can go buy some eartips but I’m really offended that such a reputable product was sent out missing essential parts!  Otherwise, so far, the product seems as advertised."
"Personally I love them, they are small and easy to bring with wherever I go. Perfect for college and walking to and from class. Sounds is good, calling normally works great. I don't own an iPhone and they work great but a few less features but I knew that going in."
"Apple has found gold with their airpods. They have gone through the wash multiple times and still worked. I just bought a new pair for my wife because I know they will get used and last forever. Great product, and worth every penny over the competition."
"The Apple AirPods 2nd Generation have proven to be an absolute hit, and my niece absolutely loves them! These wireless earbuds have become an essential companion for her daily activities, from listening to music and podcasts to taking calls and engaging in virtual classes.One of the standout features of the AirPods 2nd Gen is their seamless connectivity with Apple devices. The pairing process is incredibly easy, and once connected, they automatically sync with her iPhone, iPad, and other Apple devices. This simplicity and convenience have made her life much easier, as she can switch between devices effortlessly without any interruption.The sound quality of the AirPods is outstanding. They deliver clear, crisp audio with excellent bass, enhancing her music-listening experience. Whether she's enjoying her favorite tunes or watching videos, the AirPods ensure an immersive sound experience without any distortion.The design of the AirPods is both sleek and comfortable. They fit perfectly in her ears, and she can wear them for extended periods without any discomfort. The earbuds' lightweight construction allows her to use them during workouts, without worrying about them falling out or causing any irritation.Battery life has been impressive as well. The AirPods hold a charge for several hours of continuous use, and the included charging case provides multiple additional charges on the go, ensuring they are always ready for use.Moreover, the AirPods' portability and compact charging case allow her to carry them anywhere conveniently. The case also offers protection and keeps the AirPods safe when not in use."
Left side ear bud just stopped working 4 months after purchase. This is the 2nd pair. Time to venture out to another brand.
After trying so bargain earbuds I bought these AirPods 2Gen. Surely best compared to the < $50 I tried yet not completely satisfied as while sound’s great bass is too lacking and no EQ available. They fall out sometimes for no understandable reasons. Clear and great phone conversation and incredible quick connection to IPhones. So yeah there’re better than most lower priced devices yet I’m still looking for better bass sound
"I didn't know that you could order the earbuds to fit your ears right, they left my ears with sores at the top of my ears. So I haven't ordered them again. They also get loss and drop out of your ear. Mine fell out on the airplane and I couldn't find it before I got off, I was the last person on the airplane."
"I might be the only person that doesnt like the little foam pieces on earbuds these days, but they just hurt my smaller ears!This style of AirPod has always fit well, and gives a great sound quality. Took me awhile to buy them, but I can tell you they are worth it."
"I had only used off brand earbuds because I am just nervous about losing something expensive, but the tracking mechanisms work pretty well to prevent that. There is also battery percentage monitoring from your iPhone, which is really helpful to maintain them. The sound is overall better also and they are comfortable to use for long periods of time. It's also nice that there are so many cases and skins that fits, that is not so much an option with other brands. I would have liked to have had wireless charging."
Packaging wasn’t good item came in big brown Amazon paper bag did receive item on time  they seemed a little smallerI did try them out had a little trouble connecting afterwards my daughter decided she wanted the newer iPods returning item color was correct
"Great purchase. Even though these are not the pro, these are still great quality. Especially at a reduced price for refurb."
I don’t know why I didn’t buy these a lot earlier instead of fooling around with other brands! These were perfect and they work well even if they are an older model the price can’t be beat
"We bought it for the whole family, we really liked it, the quality is excellent, fast delivery, I will buy more from Amazon"
"Got 2 these on sale for 70$ for me and my son, I’d say it’s worth it for the price, a nice upgrade from the 1st generation which broke on me in less than a year hopefully these last a little longer… overall sound quality and bass is great just wish they were noise cancelling"


It is really a good buy. The sound quality as well as the features are really amazing especially considering the features are customisable
My teenage Son has a tendency of losing his AirPods so I decided to revert back to the cheapest version Apple sells & these do not disappoint! He said the sound quality is just as good as the newest generation AirPods & the noise cancellation is great as well. He’s 17yo & these fit perfectly in his ears & do not fall out. He wears these during his school days & then after during his 4-6 hour workday & can go a couple days without charging them. These come with a charging cord but no block. When I do charge them the charge to 100% is fast. For $99 these are well worth it. I purchased the Apple Care+ coverage in case these go bad & that was well worth the cost. A great Apple product I’m happy I could purchase from Amazon! I definitely recommend!
I don't like the new AirPods so I'm glad I can still buy these old ones. Works like a charm!
Prefer these over and other AirPods batter life is pretty good charges fast and fits in your ears pretty good.
"Love these Air buds, they work perfectly and fit better in my ears. I owned Bose ear buds and a year after having them, they crapped out. Bose did not stand behind their product and offered a refurbished pair for 75% of what I originally paid for a new pair! No thanks."
"Let me explain why I rated the battery life to be so low. As of now, I bought these airpods in 2020 and at the tail end of 2022, and more recently in 2023, the battery slowly declined. Although I understand that these products don't last forever, I still wanted to point out that the battery life deteriorated after only two years of use..Within the first 1.5-2 years of use, the battery was great! I went a whole day or three without having to charge them. The right air bud died much quicker than the left, even though I put them on at the same time. After two and a half years, both AirPods batteries died quickly. Since January, the left one doesn't last as long and I can only use the right one for 10 minutes. I used to connect them to my HP, but since January, it no longer works. I'm debating on ordering more because they are useful when using my phone."
"The sound quality is splendid, and it all works very well! Great purchase would recommend if you have the money"
My adult son prefers this style- he lost his 2nd Gen pair.  Now very happy with his new pair (birthday gift from parents).  This is the only pair he is comfortable with. You can go wrong with Apple quality- worth the money!  Excellent product.
Great sound and quality for the price.  Super easy to blu-tooth to my phone as well.  Highly recommend!
"I’ve had my Apple iPods for a while now, after buying probably six or seven of the less expensive pairs. It is worth the extra expense, believe me. My husband asked me to get him a pair, and he absolutely loves them. He wears them every time he’s exercising or goes out for a walk. They come in very clearly and you can take phone calls as well as listen to your favorite tunes. I would highly recommend."
They worked flawlessly at first. But recently they started disconnecting while I’m using them. They unpair from my phone and need to be charged more often too. For example I charged them before work this morning and I didn’t use them but 45 mins tops and only the right headphone and I already need to charge the case tonight….. They make a crackling sound when they are about to disconnect which is awful to hear. Sucks because I use them for work and my phone mic and speaker does not work well at all and I was trying get these AirPods for a temporary fix. It’s six days past the 30 day mark too so no refunds or exchanges.
Bought these for my 12 year old son and they work perfectly! Package was brand new and delivery was fast!
Anyone know the trick to keeping these big things in smaller ears!?
The quality is not bad but they aren’t real. I gave it a 1 star because I was thinking they were real
I have bought two more sets for Christmas
I love work very well
"When I got these only one would work , I sent them back for a refund and it says they received  them back but waiting on the refund ."
"Only 4 months of regular use and they sped working, not pairing at all with my iPhone."
They are good took sometime getting the sound right though.
These are good earbuds. They work great and fit my ears very nicely.
Peeps this is a must buyyyyyy definitely worth the price
Good price

Easy of hook up! 6 months free Apple Music!
These are refurbished! No where in the description did it mention that but when they came they definitely were!
The case does not hold a charge for very long. I am having to charge it every day. This shouldn’t happen. Also the AirPods will automatically connect to phone even when I am not using them. This makes me having to turn off my blue tooth. I was hoping to try and change these with the seller and get the AirPod pros but there is not way to contact this seller. I have nothing but Apple products and this is the only really top issue I have had.
"They worked great, for less than 5 months.  Amazon gave a customer support number from Apple that doesn't work.  Trying to contact Apple put me through automated system that offered no resolution.  Stated I would get a call, but the phone doesn't ring, and call is blocked.  When you call back, the call cannot be completed."
No body can hear me when I’m talking. Returned it for that reason and it’s been more than month and I haven’t received my money back!!!!
States 2nd generation AirPods. These are the 1st generation. Do not order these expecting the 2nd generation as the description says.
greatest invention ever
Great

This product was used I looked u the series number but I thought I bought it new .
It’s super comfortable. I feel nothing when wear it.
"LOVE these!  I've purchased quite a few earbuds as music is life and these are to me, by far the best sounding.  Love these and great price!!!"
"The biggest problem with this is that the when I got mine, my phone said that the two airpods are not compatible. So know I only have one to use and it sucks."
"They are Airpods, they are great. Just too big for my small ears."
no issues
one airpod stopped working after a day
The package came quickly and the quality of the earbuds are good.
"Sound, Quality and Ease of installation"
Like them alot better than I thought I would but have experienced them falling out
Got them in the time they said they were coming
It’s keep on falling off my ears
"One of the headset has a click sound. Even after updating the firmware/software/version the sound still continues (by the way, there a a LOT of compliances out there for the same issue). It also does not come with a wireless case, so you need to buy it separately or look for headsets with a wireless caseLow quality for another Apple expensive and overrated product."
The AirPods did not hold its charge.  I returned them.  Amazon takes up to 30 days to refund and has to evaluate the product.  They can give you a reduced refund if they deem so.  Do not buy electronics from Amazon!!!!
Works great just like any other apple product.
Buena calidad
Excelente sonido 1 al 10 es nuevo nuevo sin palabras muchas gracias
The assembly quality is poor.
"Stopped working after 4 months.  Microphone no longer worked with any of my devices.  Nice, but not worth the price for item that doesn't last."
"Just paid $100 for something that is worse than the previous generation item I purchased.  Won't connect to Iphone and sound cuts out after three seconds on Apple Watch.  Also no recharge status screen on charging station.  Big waste, they're going to the thrift store."
My right doesn’t work
My wife are very happy.
Thought I might have gotten some wish brand. But they were real. Already wrapped and under the tree.
Purchased for thirty five dollars and within a week one was broken.
"So happy I found this deal, great Christmas gift! Thanks!"
Everything is good except its price
It's awesome to see these available in the Amazon store. I bought them two years ago and they are still going strong!
This product was in perfect condition and the heating and the quality is great.
Suena y se conectan súper bien
Perfect sound very clear I have smaller ears and these are the only ones that actually fit and stay all day
Love everything about these air pods and all the f features!!!
Bought this for a family member and they love it
"Got these in 2020, still working great!"
Right side missing
i've always wanted airpods and these are the best and work very well.
"Ordered 2 pairs, brand new"
Excelente
Songs good
Really good
i dislike the sound quality. its very low and static sounds over the music. the quality feels fake and they seem more little then the airpods from an apple store
They sound great! Bought them during the Black Friday thing going. And they were definitely worth it for the price!
Exelente compra👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
they were on sale and they were just as great as if you would have paid full price
Right airpod is not able to hold power anymore. I just bought this for 2 months now.This is a faulty airpod.I won't come back to this website anymore. this is a scam.
great quality and sound
The media could not be loaded.
I loved them…. Work great!!!! Very happy with them
Muy buena calidad
Not worth the price

very loud and works well for school and work
Had them of only 2 months and the left ear has stopped working all together
